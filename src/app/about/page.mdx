# Intro

I'm Max, a data systems consultant based in Sweden. Through Meldrum Labs,
I help a small number of companies globally, build correct, reliable, and innovative data systems.

As a former systems researcher, I spent many years in academia building novel data systems under the supervision of Associate Prof. Carbone (Co-creator of Apache Flink)
before transitioning to industry to focus on building applied and innovative data systems.

Meldrum Labs specializes in the following areas:

* Stream Processing
* Storage Engines
