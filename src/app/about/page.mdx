# Meldrum Labs

I'm Max, a data systems consultant and investor based in Sweden. Through Meldrum Labs,
I help a small number of companies globally, building correct, reliable, and efficient data systems.

As a former systems researcher, I spent many years in academia building novel data systems under the supervision of Associate Prof. Carbone (Co-creator of Apache Flink)
before transitioning to industry to focus on building applied and innovative data systems.

I specialize in the following areas:

* Stream Processing
* Storage Engines
* Query Optimization
* Distributed Systems

## Services

Meldrum Labs architects, builds, and maintains high-performance data systems primarily in Rust.

Ideal for:

* **Greenfield development:** Building bleeding-edge data systems from scratch.
* **Architecture overhauls:** Leveling up existing systems for scalability, correctness, and efficiency.
* **Research & Prototyping:** Proof of concepts and experimental integrations for novel data systems approaches.
