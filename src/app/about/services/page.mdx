I architect and build custom, high-performance data systems primarily in Rust.

My work is ideal for:

* **Greenfield development:** Building bleeding-edge data systems from scratch.
* **Architecture overhauls:** Leveling up existing systems for scalability, correctness, and efficiency.
* **Research & Prototyping:** Proof of concepts and experimental integrations for novel data systems approaches.
