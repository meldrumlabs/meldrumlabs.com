# Meldrum Labs

Happy to share the announcement of Meldrum Labs, a company that is on a
mission to build reliable and innovative data systems.

> Meldrum Labs is a bet on that we will not be vibe-coding data systems that are backing critical pieces of infrastructure in the foreseeable future.
>
> â€” **Max Meldrum**, Founder

As a former systems researcher, I spent many years in academia building novel data systems under the supervision of Associate Prof. Carbone (Co-creator of Apache Flink) before transitioning to industry to focus on building applied and innovative data systems.

I am now starting my own venture where I will continue doing what I enjoy most - building. I will continue to work with the great folks over at [Polygon.io](https://polygon.io)
building the next-next generation of financial data systems.

## Meldrum Principles
